#### Q1: Indian Currency Notation Converter

The `convert_to_curr` function takes an integer input and converts it to Indian currency notation. If the input is less than three digits, it returns the input as is. Otherwise, it inserts commas after every two digits starting from the third digit from the end.

##### Usage:
```python
num = int(input("Enter the input:"))
convert_to_curr(num)
```

#### Q2: Counting Players to be Shot

This code snippet is designed to solve a problem where Gi-Hun and Ali need to determine the minimum number of players to be shot so that Ali is visible in Gi-Hun's line of sight. It takes multiple test cases as input, each consisting of the number of players, the height of Gi-Hun and Ali, and the heights of the players between them. For each test case, it calculates the count of players taller than Gi-Hun and Ali and appends it to the output list.
